            His story begins in the 16th century, in the heart of Antwerp,
            Belgium, where cobblestones carried the weight of trade, culture,
            and knowledge. But in a single violent ... unlucky moment, fate
            would reshape the life of a man destined to change printing of books
            as we know them today.

            It was a period where cities flourished, including the bustling port
            city of Antwerp, the biggest commercial center in this part of
            Europe.

          But ports weren't just for goods and trade, no. Within the rocking
          ships and creaky wooden boards, knowledge and culture passed through
          back and forth. It was a melting pot of ideas where culture met
          culture, and it is precisely why port cities like Antwerp became
          epicenters of art and printing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city was booming with business, becoming even more influential
          than Paris itself.
        </p>
        <p>But was the city as fortunate as it seemed?</p>
        <p>
          Among the clatter of horses and the chatter of merchants on the city's
          cobblestones stood one man with a grand vision. His name?
        </p>
        <p>
          Christophe Plantin, a successful and respected bookbinder with a rare
          talent indeed. Some might say a businessman at heart. Local Antwerp
          nobles merchants and intellectuals sought exactly him, admiring his
          thorough work with books and leather. And so, customer by customer,
          his reputation grew.

        <p>
          He was so skilful, that he realised he could not only bound books but
          also create fancy leatherworks, producing such things as small cases
          and jewel boxes for even the nobles.
        </p>
        <p>He was a master of crafts</p>
        <p>He was delicate, strong and had an eye for detail.</p>
        <p>
          But just as Plantin's business began to take off, fate, as it often
          does, had other plans...

        <p>A Life Forever Changed</p>
        <p>
          In the winding roads of Antwerp, hurried footsteps echoed on the walls
          of the city. A man was running with a package in hand. It was Plantin,
          rushing to deliver an important order.

          This is a real section of the largest and most detailed Antwerp map
          from 16th century. It's a hand-coloured woodcut that is no less than
          120 cm high and 265 cm wide. It was printed on 20 sheets of handmade
          paper.

          <p>The attack on Plantin</p>
          <div>
            <p>
              All of a sudden, shadows of the narrow streets closed in, and the
              clink of metal against stone sent a chill through him.
            </p>
            <p>
              He clutched his package tighter, his heart racing, and before he
              knew it, he was surrounded by drunken men. A rough hand grabbed
              his shoulder, and the glint of a blade flashed in the light.
            </p>
            <p>A violent interaction began, and then the sword fell.</p>

          He lived - barely. But the consequences were severe. His arm was badly
          injured.
        </p>
        <p>
          He very soon realised that he was unable to continue the physically
          demanding work of bookbinding. He was just too weak in the hand to
          continue. All of his skills down the drain went.
        </p>
        <p>For most, this would have been the end of the story.</p>
        <p>For Plantin, it was just the beginning.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p>The Golden Compass</p>
        <p>
          Plantin was truly devastated. Who wouldn't. But he had no time for
          sorrows - he had mouths to feed and a business to run. And so, he
          decided to reinvent himself and turned to printing, a field he had
          observed closely during his early years in France watching his mentor.
          He saw not just a livelihood but an opportunity to merge art,
          technology, and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>...And of course, business.</p>
        <p>
          With financial backing from Hendrik Niclaes and other patrons that he
          befriended, he established his very own printing house in Antwerp. For
          a name he decided on<br /><span

        </p>
        <p>
          And when Plantin needed to choose an emblem, something to put on his
          books, he didn't have to think long on his choice - a pair of
          compasses with the Latin motto “Labore et Constantia" or if we
          translate that to english - “Work and Perseverance”.
        </p>
        <p>A beacon of his relentless commitment to quality.</p>
        <p>Printing led to a massive increase in the speed of communication</p>
        <p>
          In 16th century - an age where communication was slow - printing
          drastically increased the speed of knowledge sharing. All of a sudden
          people had access to books and brochures.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, printing was not an easy task. It was labor-intensive process
          that required attention to detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          A single mistake - even one misspelled word - could mean huge
          financial loss and potentially bad reputation. To avoid this, Plantin
          hired people with skills specifically to check spelling and ensure the
          accuracy of every print. If a mistake was made, the entire page had to
          be redone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, this meticulous attention to detail paid off for Plantin.
          Authors all around Europe trusted Plantin's printing house for the
          precision and quality of his work. Thomas Stapleton, an English
          theologian, wrote,
        </p>

            "Above all, it was my wish to have this work printed by you, not
            only because you have the most refined type and you usually use the
            most exquisite paper, but also because, as far as I have been able
            to see, the Latin works are printed much more correctly in your
            printing house than in Paris".
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Plantin's workshop was a true marvel of organisation and craftsmanship
          of that time. It was both art and science.
        </p>
        <p>
          While he wasn't a typographer and didn't design his own fonts, he
          acquired the best typefaces from the finest Parisian foundries he
          could find, including the elegant and still very popular Garamond
          fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plantin's presses produced works in multiple languages. You could find
          languages starting from Latin to Hebrew and even music notes, often
          needing custom-designed fonts and symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          He worked with skilled engravers to create beautiful woodblock
          illustrations that brought his books alive. He skilfully blended the
          visual elements with text.
        </p>
        <p>
          But one day he was sitting in his workshop and thought of how only the
          nobles came into the shop - people who were lucky enough to have a lot
          of money. And as a good businessman, an idea struck him!
        </p>
        <p>
          The regular folk, who consisted of the majority of the population,
          couldn't afford his books. So what could he do? He realised that if he
          used woodcut illustration printing instead of engravings, he could
          sell his copies at a very much lesser price. And that he did - he sold
          the same edition in different variations and in different prices. With
          this, he reached different markets.

        <p>Trouble in the pages</p>
        <p>
          Plantin's popularity didn't come alone. 16th century was a dangerous
          time for publishers like Plantin. Religious tensions ran high. The
          divide between Catholics and Protestants meant that publishing the
          wrong text could lead to accusations of heresy - a crime that could
          result in imprisonment or even death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plantin was not immune to these dangers. As a publisher, he faced
          constant scrutiny from the Spanish Inquisition. He was worried...

          This time, Plantin was safe. But he wasn't gullible and knew he
          couldn't run and hide forever. So what did he do? He prepared for
          something big.

        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p>The big delivery</p>
        <p>
          Being clever man, he knew that for him to reach the top, he needed
          help. Plantin befriended the right people, smart people who were
          skilful in their languages, and started to employ the best printers,
          and he bought the best typefaces and woodblocks you could find.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the right time came, he decided to write to the King of Spain
          himself and offer his services, hoping he would be spared.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I dare say that Plantin's is the largest and best supplied, not only
          with all kinds of stamps and matrices, type and all other things
          useful and necessary for an independent printing office, but also with
          all kinds of illustration and ornaments, that there has ever been in
          the whole of Europe, nor can be found there at the present time. I
          therefore believe that there is no collection in the whole of Europe
          of so many beautiful and good letters as many of the most important
          printers and experts in this field from France, the German Empire and
          Italy have written".

        <p>
          His letter to the king of Spain, trying to convince him to choose
          Plantin as the publisher.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the king accepted and Plantin could start his most important work
          of his life “Polyglot Bible”, an ambitious project that solidified his
          reputation as a master printer and in the end saved him. The
          eight-volume work was a true masterpiece, featuring texts in Hebrew,
          Greek, Latin, Aramaic, and Syriac. Each language required its own
          typeface, which Plantin was prepared for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next 4 years were very productive. There was no time for rest, and
          the publishing house worked all day, every day. This long project,
          completed between 1568 and 1572, was a triumph of the printing
          innovation. The title page depicted four animals - a lion, bull, wolf,
          and lamb - peacefully sharing a trough, symbolising the harmony of
          languages and faiths. Despite financial challenges and criticism from
          theologians, the Polyglot Bible remains one of the most significant
          typographic achievements of the Renaissance, and you can see it
          yourself in the museum as well!

          At it's very peak, De Gulden Passer housed more than 20 presses and
          employed over 73 workers, making it one of the largest printing houses
          in Europe at that time. These presses printed 1,250 sheets on both
          sides per day. Plantin made a printing empire starting as just a boy
          learning book binding in a little french hamlet

          But what became of Christophe Plantin's empire of ink and paper? Did
          the revolutionary presses survive the fires of war, or do they now lie
          silent, their stories lost to time and mind? What secrets are etched
          into the Garamond matrices, or hidden within the countless books that
          shaped the minds of generations to come?

        <p>
          What mysteries linger in the old printing house where creaking
          floorboards and curious cat doors seem to guard the whispers of the
          great printing age? And why is it that the house is in the possession
          of a real Gutenberg Bible?
