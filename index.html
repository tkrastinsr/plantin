            Belgium, where cobblestones carried the weight of trade, culture,
            and knowledge. But in a single violent ... unlucky moment, fate

            as we know them today.

            city of Antwerp, the biggest commercial center in this part of
            Europe.

            120 cm high and 265 cm wide. It was printed on 20 sheets of handmade
            paper.

                He clutched his package tighter, his heart racing, and before he
                knew it, he was surrounded by drunken men. A rough hand grabbed
                his shoulder, and the glint of a blade flashed in the light.

            He very soon realised that he was unable to continue the physically
            demanding work of bookbinding. He was just too weak in the hand to
            continue. All of his skills down the drain went.

        <p>The Golden Compass</p>
        <p>
          <span class="bigger">P</span>lantin was truly devastated. Who
          wouldn't. But he had no time for sorrows - he had mouths to feed and a
          business to run. And so,
          <span class="highlight"
            >he decided to reinvent himself and turned to printing</span
          >, a field he had observed closely during his early years in France
          watching his mentor. He saw not just a livelihood but an opportunity
          to merge art, technology, and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>...And of course, business.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="bigger">W</span>ith financial backing from Hendrik
          Niclaes and other patrons that he befriended, he established his very
          own printing house in Antwerp. For a name he decided on<br /><span
            >"De Gulden Passer"The Golden Compass"</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          And when Plantin needed to choose an emblem, something to put on his
          books, he didn't have to think long on his choice - a pair of
          compasses with the Latin motto “<span class="highlight"
            >Labore et Constantia</span
          >" or if we translate that to english - “Work and Perseverance”.
        </p>
        <p>
          A beacon of his relentless
          <span class="highlight">commitment to quality</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Printing led to a massive increase in the speed of communication</p>
        <p>
          <span class="bigger">I</span>n 16th century - an age where
          communication was slow -
          <span class="highlight"
            >printing drastically increased the speed of knowledge sharing</span
          >. All of a sudden people had access to books and brochures.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, printing was not an easy task. It was labor-intensive process
          that required attention to detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          A single mistake - even one misspelled word - could mean huge
          financial loss and potentially bad reputation. To avoid this, Plantin
          hired people with skills specifically to check spelling and ensure the
          accuracy of every print. If a mistake was made, the entire page had to
          be redone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, this meticulous attention to detail paid off for Plantin.
          Authors all around Europe trusted Plantin's printing house for the
          precision and quality of his work. Thomas Stapleton, an English
          theologian, wrote,
        </p>

            <p>Thomas Stapelton</p>
          </div>

            "Above all, it was my wish to have this work printed by you, not
            only because you have the most refined type and you usually use the
            most exquisite paper, but also because, as far as I have been able
            to see, the Latin works are printed much more correctly in your
            printing house than in Paris".
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <span class="bigger">P</span>lantin's workshop was a true marvel of
          organisation and craftsmanship of that time. It was both art and
          science.
        </p>
        <p>
          While he wasn't a typographer and didn't design his own fonts, he
          acquired the best typefaces from the finest Parisian foundries he
          could find, including the elegant and still very popular
          <span class="highlight">Garamond</span>
          fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plantin's presses produced works in multiple languages. You could find
          languages starting from Latin to Hebrew and even music notes, often
          needing custom-designed fonts and symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight"

          that brought his books alive. He skilfully blended the visual elements
          with text.
        </p>
        <p>
          But one day he was sitting in his workshop and thought of how only the
          nobles came into the shop - people who were lucky enough to have a lot
          of money. And as a good businessman, an idea struck him!
        </p>
        <p>
          The regular folk, who consisted of the majority of the population,
          couldn't afford his books. So what could he do? He realised that if he
          used woodcut illustration printing instead of engravings, he could
          sell his copies at a very much lesser price. And that he did - he sold
          the same edition in different variations and in different prices. With
          this, <span class="highlight">he reached different markets</span>.

        <p>Trouble in the pages</p>
        <p>
          <span class="bigger">P</span>lantin's popularity didn't come alone.
          16th century was a dangerous time for publishers like Plantin.
          Religious tensions ran high. The divide between Catholics and
          Protestants meant that
          <span class="highlight"
            >publishing the wrong text could lead to accusations of heresy</span
          >
          - a crime that could result in imprisonment or even death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plantin was not immune to these dangers. As a publisher, he faced
          constant scrutiny from the Spanish Inquisition. He was worried...

          gullible and knew he couldn't run and hide forever. So what did he do?
          <span class="highlight">He prepared for something big</span>.

        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p>The big delivery</p>
        <p>
          <span class="bigger">B</span>eing clever man, he knew that for him to
          reach the top, he needed help. Plantin befriended the right people,
          smart people who were skilful in their languages, and started to
          employ the best printers, and he bought the best typefaces and
          woodblocks you could find.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the right time came, he decided to write to the
          <span class="highlight">King of Spain</span>
          himself and offer his services, hoping he would be spared.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<span class="highlight"
            >I dare say that Plantin's is the largest and best supplied</span
          >,<br />not only with all kinds of stamps and matrices, type and all
          other things useful and necessary for an independent printing office,
          but also with all kinds of illustration and ornaments, that there has
          ever been in the whole of Europe, nor can be found there at the
          present time. I therefore believe that there is no collection in the
          whole of Europe of so many beautiful and good letters as many of the
          most important printers and experts in this field from France, the
          German Empire and Italy have written".

          Plantin as the publisher.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the king accepted and Plantin could start
          <span class="highlight"
            >his most important work of his life “Polyglot Bible”</span
          >, an ambitious project that solidified his reputation as a master
          printer and in the end saved him. The eight-volume work was a true
          masterpiece,
          <span class="highlight"
            >featuring texts in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Aramaic, and Syriac</span
          >. Each language required its own typeface, which Plantin was prepared
          for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next 4 years were very productive. There was no time for rest, and
          the publishing house worked all day, every day. This long project,
          <span class="highlight">completed between 1568 and 1572</span>, was a
          triumph of the printing innovation. The title page depicted four
          animals - a lion, bull, wolf, and lamb - peacefully sharing a trough,
          symbolising the harmony of languages and faiths. Despite financial
